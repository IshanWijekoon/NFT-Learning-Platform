## 🚀 **How the System Works**

### **1. Course Creation (Creator Side)**
```
Creator uploads course → Includes NFT certificate template → 
System stores template → Course ready for enrollment
```

### **2. Certificate Awarding (Automatic)**
```
Learner completes course → System checks completion → 
Generates unique NFT key → Creates certificate record → 
Updates enrollment status → Certificate awarded!
```

### **3. Certificate Verification (Public)**
```
Anyone enters verification code → System validates → 
Shows certificate details → Tracks verification count
```

}
```

### **Certificate Hash:**
```php
function generateCertificateHash($course_id, $learner_id, $nft_key) {
    $data = $course_id . '|' . $learner_id . '|' . $nft_key . '|' . time();
    return hash('sha256', $data);
}
```
